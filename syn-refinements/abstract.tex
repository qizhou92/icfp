  % context:
  Refinement types are a fragment of dependent types that can express
  practical, desirable partial-correctness properties.
  %
  Previous engines that check if a program has a desired refinement
  type synthesize refinements of base and function types, but can only
  use provided recursive refinement types.

  % primary contribution:
  The primary contribution of this work is a type-engine, named \sys,
  that simultaneously synthesizes sufficient refinements of recursive
  base types, and infers types of program sub-expressions.
  %
  \sys can potentially synthesize recursive refinement types that are
  universally quantified over base, function, and recursive values.
  %
  The key feature of \sys is a syntax-directed translation from a
  type-checking problem to a system of Constrained Horn Clauses.
