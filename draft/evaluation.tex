\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:evaluation}
%
In this section, we introduce several pairs of coding solutions,
translated to functional programs.
%
For each pair of programs $P_0$ and $P_1$, we identify an inductive
set of pairs of expressions $I$, and give a map from all pairs of
expressions in $I$ to relational invariants that prove the partial
equivalence of $P_0$ and $P_1$.

\autoref{fig:climb-stairs} contains the pseudocode for two solutions
to the Climbing Stairs Problem hosted on the coding platform the
LeetCode.
% problem statement:
The Climbing Stairs Problem is to take an integer $n$ and return the
number of distinct sequences of steps that can be taken to climb $n$
steps, where in each step either one or two steps can be climbed. If
$n$ is less than or equal to one, then the solution is one.
%
\BH{walk through how the two solutions work}

%
\cc{climbStairs0} and \cc{climbStairs1} have an inductive subset of
subexpression pairs that prove their equivalence.
