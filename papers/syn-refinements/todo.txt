-background

  +language: assumption: all variables that occur in abstractions and
   fixpoints are distinct

  +define component types of a type

  +define space of base types

    -recursive types: each uses no value parameters

  +define symbolic variables of an expression (merge from equivalence
   draft)

-approach

  +define syntax directed translation

  +define constraint generation per expression

-intro

  +next pass: abstract what we pick up based on writing the technical
   section

-conceptual

  +what are the variables of each relational predicate
